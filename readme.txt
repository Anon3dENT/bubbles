Assembly
1. Test fit all the 3D parts together and especially the lid on the jar
2. Roll your Sugru into a long snake about 200mm long
3. Press this snake into the space inside the lid between the threads and the ring. See the pic lid.jpg
4. Screw the Sugru-ed lid onto the mason jar to shape the Sugru into a seal, as seen in lid.jpg
5. Remove the lid, check out the sweet groove. The Sugru needs to set for 24 hours before you can use it
